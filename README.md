## Summary
This is a static web app that fetches data from a CSV file, calculates the total sales amount, and displays it on a single-page site.

## Setup
To deploy this app on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload the HTML and CSV files to the repository.
3. Go to the repository's settings.
4. Under the GitHub Pages section, choose the main branch as the source.
5. Your site will be published at `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`.

## Usage
Access the page by visiting `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`. You can add query parameters to filter or manipulate the data shown on the page.

## Code Explanation
The app uses JavaScript to fetch the data.csv file and parse it into an array of objects, handling trailing newlines and empty rows. It then calculates the total sales by summing the sales column and displays it inside the `#total-sales` element. Bootstrap 5 is loaded from jsdelivr to enhance the page layout.
